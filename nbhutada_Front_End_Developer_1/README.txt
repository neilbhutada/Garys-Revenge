Contributions Week 2:
---------------------
Plan to work on Regex.
I also attempted make an api using Node js to connect the front end with back end. However, arrangement was too complicated to work with.

I made all the HTML, CSS, JS files. Linked Backend with Frontend using WebView on JavaFX. Also created a layout in JavaFX.

Contributions Week 3:
---------------------
 Made and integrated the entire frontend with rest of the application. 

Files written by me:
--------------------
game.html 
game.css 
game.js
FrontEnd.java

Files submitted with this project that were developed in an earlier project:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional notes about the submission:
--------------------------------------
The project works perfectly fine on Eclipe and on the VM; however, the VM doesnt have the fonts that my eclipse editor has. Therefore, due to the different fonts on the VM the positioning might be slightly off. Also, our UI was made with having a 600 x 600 frame. You do not need to expand the JavaFX frame to play the game.
